# Smoking Detection And Alert Based On YOLOv8

This project is based on Object Detection module which is trained on YOLOv8 . The code detect's the traces of cigarette from the live video using the pre-trained PyTorch module and sends an alert email using the python smtp protocol.


The images were collected and annotated using roboflow website and implemented into the code as the PyTorch module that was trained upto 80 epochs . 


All the annotated images used in this project is from this roboflow profile : https://universe.roboflow.com/project-oq1mv/smoking-detection-qiiqe
